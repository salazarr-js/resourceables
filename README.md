# 📚 Resourceables
A curated list of useful dev resources

## 📖 Reason
Over time, I've followed many people and projects on platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and GitHub.
This has introduced me to countless tools, services, apps, packages, courses, guides, and tutorials that are incredibly useful for developers.
However, with so much information, finding what’s truly helpful can become overwhelming.

That’s why I decided to create this curated list. The goal is to make searching for and finding the resources you need easy, without getting lost in the noise.
