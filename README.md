# 📚 Resourceables
A curated list of useful dev resources

## 📖 Reason

Over time, I've followed many people and projects on platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and GitHub.
This has introduced me to countless tools, services, apps, packages, courses, guides, and tutorials that are incredibly useful for developers.
However, with so much information out there, it can become overwhelming to find what’s truly helpful.

That’s why I decided to create this curated list. The goal is to make it easy to search for and find the resources you need, without getting lost in the noise.
